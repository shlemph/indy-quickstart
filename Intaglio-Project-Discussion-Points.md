"Even an Immutble Blockchain needs Comprehensive Reputation Management" 

The Intaglio Blockchain starts with 3 primitive assumptions, 

1) It is a write only immutable blockchain making it's content non-reputiatable / while making read only access available for rule based inspection and validation 

2) Every Block in the chain is linked to a trackable individual identity, and linked to the authority roles enpowered to publish content 

3) Both the Identity and Authority each pushlisher are available both for the moment in time that the block was published, and reference information on the publishers past and future reputation. 

A Record that appears to have all of the Halmarks of Trustworthyness may be of subject questionable integrity or change of status based on information discovered in the future. 

At the time of publishing, the publisher of each record will certify that to the best of their knowledge the information is true and correct at the time. 

If doubts occur in the future about the credibitiy or reliability of a record, Warning Flags can be attached for either the entry, the publishing individual, the organization that they represent, or the ssources that were relied upon for the attestation of claims recorded in the chain.

No records once accepted will ever be removed, and will contain assertions, attestations, claims, counterclaims, and historical context for the blocks.  

These procedures will be implmented using a combination of: 

* Distributed Identity Based Public Key Encryption based Identity Mangement
* Block Publishing Restricted to Authorized Identity and Role based Identity Keys confirmed using multi-phase authentication 
* Read Only Blockchain for Public Inspection 

* Distributed Individual Identity Certificates
* Linkages between Individual identity, Organization Roles, and Accredication Attribution

* distributed data exchange 

* Record Notorization 
* Distributed Multi-Trust Attestation 

* Chain of Custody Tracking of ownsership, transfer, escrow, rights restrictions, option, auction, lein, and other contrctual custodial obligations  

* Certificates of Origin 
* Certificates of Materials 
* Certificates of Permissible Use Licensing

* Certificates of Grant for conditional Performance, Display or Publication 

* Cross Datasource and Blockchain Linking for Attribute and Prvonance History 

* Distributed Identify Attribution Protocols
* Distributed Organizational Role Attribution Protocols
* Distributed Accomplishment Attribution Protocols
* Distributed Recognition Attribution Protocols
* Distributed Recognition Attribution Protocols


* Temporal and Geographic Location and Custodianship Tracking

* Extendable industry-specific module expansion

* Together this builds the infrastructure for a peer-to-peer trust network which is cross-chain, cross-system, cross-industry, cross-application, and cross-device
