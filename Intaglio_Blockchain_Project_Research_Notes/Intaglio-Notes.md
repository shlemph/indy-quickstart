Overview of Intaglio Blockchain Solution 

The Intaglio Blockchain Solution is a Trust based Interoperable Blockchain Solution Built for Provenance Tracking of cultural objects. 

Intaglio Blockchain Solution  is a cross-ledger agnostic communications system that enables high-performance exchange and validation solution for tracking the Identification and Provenance of cultural artifacts by trusted and authenticated parties and sources.   

The Intaglio Blockchain Solution is not simply an individual self contained blockchain operating on it’s on, it is a mechanism for connecting time stamped inter blockchain ledgers connecting information from mutually trusted parties and sources connected over an immutable network.  

Non authoritative parties can query and interact with the contents of the Intaglio Blockchain Solution, but only trusted and validated parties may post content to the ledger.  Ledger entries themselves are signed and timestamped links, which will extend to an associated digital object stores containing images, data, and metadata about items listed in or referenced by the Master Intaglio Ledger.  The Master Intaglio Ledger will be managed using a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus scheme, where validation is performed not based on proof of work, or proof of stake, but on proof of Authority, as determined by a governance body known as the Intaglio Board of Authority.

This Intaglio Ledger Board of Authority mechanism allows for a publicly recognized group to adopt new trusted participants, resolve potential conflicts, remove bad actors, and thus preserve the integrity of the chain, while under the oversight of an Published set of Bylaws that are being drafted to create a long term custodianship for what will be come the trusted ledger of record for cultural artifacts around the world..  

The Master Intaglio Ledger will link to other Linked Data Sources as approved by the Intaglio Ledger Board of Authority as defined in the Intaglio Board of Authority Bylaws. It may also contain links to unverified external reference materials held by third party sources 

Authenticated Publishers to the network called Validated Data Contributors will be able to publish entries and their associated digital objects to the Master Intaglio Ledger, and Intaglio Synchronized Data Arc either through direct individual record submission or cross chain synchronization.

Validated Data Contributors running their own independent chains will propose their records for submission into the Master Intaglio Ledger, along with the associated content to be included in the Master Intaglio Data Object Store. Those meeting the standards approved by Intaglio Board of Authority Bylaws will be appended to the Master Intaglio Ledger.

Records Proposed by a Validated Data Contributor will still subject to final review and acceptance before becoming permanent additions to the Master Intaglio Ledger and the Master Intaglio Data Object Store based on the standards published by the Intaglio Ledger Board of Authority as defined in   Intaglio Board of Authority Bylaws, and coded into the published Intaglio Record Validation API that is in effect at the time of the publishing of the entry.

As part of the terms of engagement for inclusion in the Intaglio Master Ledger, contributors who run their own separate blockchain agree to Enrollment in and continuous synchronize with the Intaglio Data Arc,  A Controlled Repository, designed for the Preservation, of the elements of their Ledger in perpetuity as defined in and managed by the bylaws and oversight of the Intaglio Ledger Board of Authority, who is the long term custodian of all content and related metadata recorded and stored in Master Intaglio Ledger,  Master Intaglio Data Object Store , and Linked Chains provided for reference by Validated Data Contributors to the Intaglio Ledger Board of Authority as part of the repository. 

Integrity of the data stored as part of the Master Intaglio Ledger,  Master Intaglio Data Object Store , and Linked Chains will be attributed to those responsible for submission through the of the Validated Data Contribution by coupling the entries with public key infrastructure (PKI) which will incorporate identity management, nodes (and node operators). 

These identities will be supplied via time limited Digital Certificates validated against the time stamped ledger and a real time revocation list, that has been linked to a compliance server for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures as adopted and published by Intaglio Ledger Board of Authority.

Defined Organizational Trust hierarchies will enable individual participant organizations to locally manage both individual, role, and organizational rights locally, for maximal control, while having the ability to invalidate, revoke, or redefine credentials within moments without going outside of their organization within the permissions delegated to them by the .policies of the Intaglio Ledger Board of Authority.  Third parties will be able to rely on the records in the ledger by comparing the content of the digital signature with a certificate and a timeline from the shared immutable ledger.

This design allows for a scalable, flexible and transparent solution for cross-organization reference of Provenance data across and participants both today, and in the future even in the event of the discontinuation of participation by any former Validated Data Contributor.

By using role control with PKI, Validated Data Contributors can also operate their own local permission-ed blockchains which can contain, and preserve both “Certified and Non-Certified Data.”   

Validated Data Contributors will be able to define the precise role of node operators that participate on their local blockchains, as needed by their business models, and have still be able to contribute Validated Data seamlessly into the Master Intaglio Ledger.


In addition, by utilizing a Linked Chain Solution based on the Master Intaglio Ledger unified framework, companies can develop their distributed ledger technology application with a single codebase and simultaneously launch their product across multiple infrastructure networks of their choosing.
